You can catch thrown items by toggling on your throw mode with an empty hand active.
You can climb onto a table by dragging yourself onto one. This takes time and drops the items in your hands on the table. Clicking on a table that someone else is climbing onto will knock them down.
You can drag other players onto yourself to open the strip menu, letting you remove their equipment or force them to wear something. Note that exosuits or helmets will block your access to the clothing beneath them, and that certain items take longer to strip or put on than others.
Clicking on a windoor rather then bumping into it will keep it open, you can click it again to close it.
You can spray a fire extinguisher, throw items or fire a gun while floating through space to change your direction. Simply fire opposite to where you want to go.
You can change the control scheme by pressing tab. One is WASD, the other is the arrow keys. Keep in mind that hotkeys are also changed with this.
Glass shards can be welded to make glass, and iron rods can be welded to make iron. Ores can be welded too, but this takes a lot of fuel.
If you need to drag multiple people either to safety or to space, bring a locker or crate over and stuff them all in before hauling them off.
You can grab someone by holding Ctrl and clicking on them, then upgrade the grab by Ctrl-clicking on them once more. An aggressive grab will momentarily stun someone, allow you to place them on a table by clicking on it, or throw them by toggling on throwing.
Holding alt and left clicking a tile will allow you to see its contents in the top right window pane, which is much faster than right clicking.
The resist button will allow you to resist out of handcuffs, being buckled to a chair or bed, out of locked lockers and more. Whenever you're stuck, try resisting!
You can move an item out of the way by dragging it and then clicking on an adjacent tile with an empty hand.
You can recolor certain items like jumpsuits and gloves in washing machines by also throwing in a crayon.
When in doubt about technicial issues, clear your cache (byond launcher > cogwheel > preferences > game prefs), update your BYOND, and relog.
Most things have special interactions with right, alt, shift, and control click. Experiment!
Different weapons have different strengths. Some weapons, such as spears, floor tiles, and throwing stars, deal more damage when thrown compared to when attacked normally.
A thrown glass of water can make a slippery tile, allowing you to slow down your pursuers in a pinch.
We were all new once, be patient and guide new players in the right direction.
On most clothing items that go in the exosuit slot, you can put certain small items into your suit storage, such as a spraycan, your emergency oxygen tank, or a flashlight.
If you're using hotkey mode, you can stop pulling things using H.
If there's something you need from another person, try asking! This game isn't singleplayer and you'd be surprised what you can get accomplished together!
You'll quickly lose your interest in the game if you play to win and kill. If you find yourself doing this, take a step back and talk to people - it's a much better experience!
Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether from your peers or from admins.
When crafting most items, you can either manually combine parts or use the crafting menu.
In a pinch, stripping yourself naked will give you a sizeable resistance to being tackled. What do you value more, your freedom or your dignity?
If you're bleeding, you can apply pressure to the limb by grabbing yourself while targeting the bleeding limb. This will slow you down and take up a hand, but it'll slow down how fast you lose blood. Note this won't help the bleeding clot any faster.
Laying down will help slow down bloodloss. Death will halt it entirely.
♪ Hey, have you ever tried appending the % character before your messages when speaking in-game? ♫
@You can use the |, + and _ characters to emphasize parts of what you say in-game (e.g. say"my _ass_ |is| +heavy+." will be outputted as "my <u>ass</u> <i>is</i> <b>heavy</b>."). You can also escape these emphasizers by appending backslashes before them (e.g. say"1\+2\+3" will come out as "1+2+3" and not "1\<b>2\</b>3").
